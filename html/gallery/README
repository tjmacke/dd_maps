src.??.obscured.json	-- Two variable time series.

	A door-dasher agreed to collect data of all of her deliveries in exchange for whatever I
	could learn.  In her first month she delivered from 33 restaurants.  The 5 maps in this
	series show two variables: the number of weeks since the last delievery from a restaurant
	as the pin color with red being within 1 week, and "cooling" down throuhg orange, yellow,
	etc to light gray at 26+ weeks and dark gray at 52+ weeks.  This size of the pin represents
	the total number of visists.  The 01, 05, etc, are the data for the original 33 restaurants
	at months 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17. Click on a pin to see that restauarant's exact data.
